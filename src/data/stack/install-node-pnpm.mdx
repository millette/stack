To install the latest pnpm and the node LTS run the following in your terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
bash # or restart the terminal to load new $PATH
pnpm env use --global lts
pnpm --version # should output something like 9.12.0
node --version # should output something like v20.17.0
which pnpm # should output something like ~/.local/share/pnpm/pnpm
which node # should output something like ~/.local/share/pnpm/node
```

If `which` outputs something other than `~/.local/share/pnpm/...` it's probably because
you already have node or pnpm installed and your `$PATH` is finding those first.

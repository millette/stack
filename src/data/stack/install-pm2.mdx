PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer.
It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime
and to facilitate common system admin tasks.

```sh
pnpm install --global pm2
```

You can use the short version:

```sh
pnpm i -g pm2
```

You must initialize PM2 to run as a service:

```sh
pm2 startup
```
